# zip-files-individually

A quick little C# program to zip up each file in a folder in its own zip file.


## To Dos

- pass in arguments for path and valid extensions should look like `zip-files <extension-list> <path>`
- confirm path is valid directory (if missing, this is an error)
- confirm that extensions have been passed in (if missing, this is an error)
